1The functions fgets() reads up to n-1 characters from the input 
stream referenced by fp. It copies the read string into the 
buffer buf, appending a null character to terminate the string.

2If this function encounters a newline character '\n' or the end 
of the file EOF before they have read the maximum number of 
characters, then it returns only the characters read up to that 
point including the new line character. You can also use int 
fscanf(FILE *fp, const char *format, ...) function to read 
strings from a file, but it stops reading after encountering the 
first space character.

3Let's see a little more in detail about what happened here. 
First, fscanf() read just This because after that, it encountered 
a space, second call is for fgets() which reads the remaining 
line till it encountered end of line. Finally, the last call 
fgets() reads the second line completely. END!
